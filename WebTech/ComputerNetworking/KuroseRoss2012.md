# Slides from Kurose Ross Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach

## Questions

* ISPs
* Internet standards: RFC, IETF
* 802.11
* Network Edge

## Ch1 Introduction

What is the internet

* Nuts and Bolts
  * Hosts = end systems, running network apps
  * Communication Links: their transmission rate is bandwidth, and they are fiber, copper, radio, satellite
  * Packet Switches: They forward packets through routers or switches
  * **Protocols** control the sending and recieving of messages
    * TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11
  * The internet is a network of networks, interconnected ISPs
  * Internet Standards: RFC=Request for comments, IETF=Internet Engineering Task force
* Service View
  * The internet provides services to applications: Web, VoIP, email...
  * Provides programming interfaces to apps
    * Hooks allow sending and recieving app programs to connect to the internet
    * Similar to post office
  * Protocols define the format, order of msgs sent and recieved among entities, and actions taken on msg transmission
    * Example: TCP connection request -> TCP connection response -> Get url -> URL sent back

Network Edge

* Network Edge: Clients and servers, where servers are in a data center
* End Systems = client devices
* Edge Router
  * Connects end system to outside world
  * Design decision on shared vs dedicated, also bandwidth
* Access Net
  * DSL = Digital Subscriber Line
  * Used existing telephone line to transmit data
  * Connects to a DSL Access multiplexer
  * Muxer split on data type: data went to internet VoDSL went to phone
  * Upstream Transmission Rate = < 2.5 Mbps, usually  greater than 1Mbps
  * Downstream Transmission rate = < 24 Mbps, typically more than 10Mbps
* Network Core: Interconnected routers and network of networks
* Links
