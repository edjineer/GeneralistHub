Estimated Completion Time = 6 hours

## Part 1: How to Approach a System Design Interview

* Engineering is great when you know there is one great solution out there
* Design problems are where there is no fixed or predetermined outcome
  * You're creating a map for someone else to find the solution
  * Think like a Tech Lead: explain to junior engineers
* Pro Tip/Strategy: Answer enough details for the interviewer to dive into your strengths on their own.
* Looking for: Broad understanding of fundamentals, back and forth on constraints and parameters, qualified decisions based on trade-offs, Unique direction based on experience, holistic view of system and its users.
* Not Looking for: deep expertise, assumptions, predefined path, specific answers, technical considerations.
* Ask details around what type of sercice the interviewer wants you to build: who are the users, what type of traffic, what limits?
* Example: Data model with an ID introduced:
  * Are IDs exposed to users? How long do they need to be t oavoid collisions? Visibility from auto incrementing and guessing ids? Confusing characters like 1,0?
* Anchor Decisions in the **user experiences** they create
  * Example: Log in before uploading a picture: pros and cons to each approach
* Red Flags and Green Flags
  * G: Communicate honestly about what you do and don't know
  * Embrace Feedback, make it collaborative
  * Direct more of the interview
  * Don't leave long stretches of silence
  * Weight pros and cons, but **make a decision** before moving on to other components. "Based on all these tradeoffs, I'll use this type"
* Say the generic name of a component, not a brannd name. Don't say "Kafka", say "a queue"

## Part 2: 15 Fundamental System Design Concepts

Time: *70 minute read, 2.5 hours of videos*

## Part 3: A 3 Step Framework to crush any system Design interview

## Part 4: Watch us design simple systems from scratch, adn learn how to get unstuck

## Questions for Later

* For instance, you should understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, their broad performance characteristics, and the types of applications each might be useful for (which weâ€™ll teach you later in this guide).

## Next Steps

* Address Remaining Questions
* Read Bill Brnett and Dave Evans' "Designing your Life"
